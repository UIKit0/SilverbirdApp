/**
 A subclass of SynthesiserSound that represents a sampled audio clip.
 
 This is a pretty basic sampler, and just attempts to load the whole audio stream
 into memory.
 
 To use it, create a Synthesiser, add some SamplerVoice objects to it, then
 give it some SampledSound objects to play.
 
 @see SamplerVoice, Synthesiser, SynthesiserSound

     source, in seconds
